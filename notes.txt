jug: Easy-to-grasp shape with big opening so that entire hand can fit in. Offers good rest.
sloper: Large rounded and smooth holds with no positive edge. The textured surface is used to create friction and hold them.


tiny footholds: Tiny, eventually slippery foot holds.
edging: Using the edge of the climbing shoe to push on a foothold. Usually done when the climber stands parallel to the wall and wants to keep it that way.
smearing: 
contre-pointe: Using the upper part of the foot (toes) to hold on to a hold or volume. Often done to control an imbalance.
heel-hook: Locking the heel between the wall and a hold or against a volume or hold. This technique is used to keep the body close to the wall when doing a move or to control an imbalance. This is also used when mantling on top of a boulder.

python manage.py migrate:
	actually applies the modification to the databases
	
WHY: so that people can modify auto-generated files in 'migrations' before applying the modifs to the database
